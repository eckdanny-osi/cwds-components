Component library for CWDS

TypeScript and Bootstrap4, FontAwesome

Build... yarn link... Live CRA feedback

TODOs

 * [x] Embed FontAwesome
 * [x] Fix Build Task watching
 * [ ] Document Dev workflow (e.g.; yarn link + CRA)
 * [ ] Benefits of Typing (exported *.d.ts AND typescript goodies)
 * [x] Move dist into root (for more sensical imports)
 * [x] Move dist back into dist (just copy src and package.json into dist and publish from there!)
 * [ ] Ignore certain globs from rimraf (e.g.; index.js.. just overright b/c it breaks CRA webpack devserver on rebuild)
 * [ ] move `cwds-example` to `example`
 * [ ] Automate component creation (see tmpl)
 * [ ] Add Jest
 * [ ] Add storybook
